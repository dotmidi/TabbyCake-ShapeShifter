* [X] slow down when on triangles (0.9x the speed?) (it was 0.75)
* [ ] which is better

  * [ ] the triangle slowing down but gravity stays >20 or <-20
  * [ ] gravity becoming low so the shape can skrrt off of it and get launched
* [ ] better indicator for when one life left (text in middle? heart indicator?)
* [ ] pickups

  * [ ] coins
  * [ ] pickups could restore health back to 1(?)
* [ ] shapeshifting

  * [ ] always start as red square, only see red square enemies (also think about background change (maybe too much just for the demo?))
  * [ ] implement gates for changing shape
    * [ ] create prefab with proper polygon collider
