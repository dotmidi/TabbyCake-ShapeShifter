* [X] slow down when on triangles (0.9x the speed?) (it was 0.75)
* [X] which is better

  * [X] the triangle slowing down but gravity stays >20 or <-20

  * ~~ gravity becoming low so the shape can skrrt off of it and get launched~~
* [ ] better indicator for when one life left (text in middle? heart indicator?)

  * [ ] small writing of health 2/2 - 1/2 etc in the bottom left
* [ ] pickups

  * [ ] coins
  * [ ] shape based pickups (picked up shape will be morphed into)
* [ ] shapeshifting

  * [ ] always start as red square, only see red square enemies (also think about background change (maybe too much just for the demo?)
* [ ] if more than 2 shapes on one side of the area, switch to other side
